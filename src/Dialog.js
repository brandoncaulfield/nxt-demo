            Imagine creating and training an artificially intelligent digital
            version of yourself that lives on your mobile devices who can learn
            and automate your daily tasks and workflows, keeping you connected
            from anywhere in the world.

            The world is in a constant state of change with companies trying to
            find ways to adapt to this ever-evolving environment in order to
            keep employeeâ€™s happy and attract the highest calibre of staff.
            Countries worldwide are trialling 4-day work weeks and work from
            home initiatives, meaning there is a need to adapt the way the
            intelligent enterprise approaches the future "mobile friendly" work
            environment. Stronger security through human/device interfaces are
            needed to enable safe and secure access to confidential company data
            from servers off-site.

            At SAP we envision our apps running on any device with the
            capability to learn from a users unique behaviour and, over time,
            present relevant and concise data from and an SAP system straight to
            the user before they've even asked for it. We believe that through
            artificial intelligence and machine learning we can help users build
            a digital model of their interactions and preferences, captured on
            the devices themselves, and use that model to pull data directly
            from SAP's API's, and then present it in a meaningful way as and
            when its needed. All of this without the need for any user
            interaction at all.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Using the strong and robust security measures, like Apple's FaceID
            and end-to-end encryption already built into these mobile devices,
            we can ensure private and confidential company data is accessed
            securely and facilitate proper data authorisation seamlessly. We
            also ensure user privacy is carefully respected as all "learned
            behaviour" is stored on the device itself and data from SAP's
            external API's is seamlessly integrated into the users daily
            workflow.

          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Cleverly mapped and considered user behaviour paired with SAP's
            business intelligence capabilities will create a powerful symbiosis
            that drives a company boldly forward into the future.
